> A simple template for making a Discord bot in TypeScript using the Akairo framework

## Getting started

## Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Setting up

You will need to add your bot's token (which you can get from the Discord developers portal. https://discord.com/developers) into the Config.ts file. Then, set a prefix by changing the prefix variable to whichever prefix you want. Optionally, you can add your User ID to the owners variable to use owner-only commands.

Then you can compile using the `tsc` command.
Once the compiler has finished, type `node dist/Bot.js` to start the bot. If everything worked, your bot should go online and you can try the ping command.
